    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
    Roxy, our extraordinary academic sensation! This four-legged scholar not only aced the Navy SEAL fitness test in the first division but also casually picked up a PhD from Harvard at the age of 3. Roxy is not just a brainiac; she boasts over 1200+ publications and citations in quantum physics. When she's not diving into the depths of academia, Roxy transforms into an Olympic-level swimmer, leaving even the fastest humans in her wake. With an IQ higher than your average human
    </p>
    <h2>Early life and Career</h2>
    <p>Roxy is known to be born in the battlefields of syria and iraq in early 2019 .With early enrollment in the US army she spent half of her life gathering the tactical and warfield skills required to 
        neutralize any nation trying to disrupt your peace. Thereafter gaining experience in the battlefields she sailed smoothly throughout the promotion levels. During the late 2019 the CIA found out that she is an Indian spy on a mission to fight for the animal rights in the US and kill every anti-animal right activist. She was deported soon after.
        Wandering in the streets of West Delhi she catched my moms eyes and that is when her life took a delightful turn. She said "i still get haunted dreams from the warfield" that's when i know i will have to pat her down to make her calm.
        Despite being equipped with extraordinary war,tactical skills and the ability to stop the wars around the world and maintain global peace she chooses not to and We (the family members) completely respect it.
        Some pics from the syria mission.
